# HR-management-system

#in this update I created a new Listener/EventHandler an event handler  that takes input from a form elemt and prints the output information in a card that is basically a div element.

#worked on the styling of the website and made it Responsive.

#created an asset folder that contains employee images
#Changed the render function to call other functions and to create new div elements in which the new employee cards will be diusplayed and controlled their style by giving them an Id (.className)

#Created a function to create a randomly generated number and display it in the card, each time the user creates a submition a new unique Id is displayed along with other user information

#Made some changes on html.index file like adding a form element and section and divs to contain content

#Added style to the header and footer font from google

#This project is an HR-management-system where a company can review employees information
#This is the initial update, created two pages Home & accounting added app.js file as a constructor to show on home page employee info(Full name and salary)
